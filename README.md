# Study and Evaluation Techniques of Text Mining in Tweets for Politics

## Abstract
Social networks generate every minute huge amounts of data, which occurs due to their large adoption and daily use in recent years. The need for wider use in various areas of social business life has been created. For this reason, techniques and algorithms for text processing, such as Text Mining and Sentiment Analysis, have been developed.
In this paper, we have collected a set of data from Twitter for the two key candidates in the last US election (Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton). Using text processing algorithms, we try to find "popular" words for each candidate and create a prediction mechanism, according to which a random tweet is categorized as one of the two candidates as positive or negative. 
Two supervised learning algorithms, Na√Øve Bayes and  Support Vector Machines (SVM) are the basis for the production of predictive classifiers and the accuracy of them. The Python sklearn library is used to pre-process and apply algorithms. In addition, we preview the Orange3 tool and follow the same process of analyzing the dataset and evaluate the usability and performance of the tool.
